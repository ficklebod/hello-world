<h1>A bit about me</h1>
<p>I've toyed around with <i>very very</i>basic html and CSS a few times over the years but never got very far. I'm now working for a tech company, albeit in the customer service dept, and want to take this opportunity to pick up learning again. My boss is happy for me to ask folk in the tech team to help me out here and there and Dan has already kindly offered to give me tips and little exercises. Managed ex.1 - write a fizz-buzz creation funciton.</p>
  <p>I'm working through freecodecamp's lessons as my main learning hub, find the w3schools site good as a quick reference guide and have a couple of mini projects that I'm trying out too.</p>
